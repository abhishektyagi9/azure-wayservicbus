### Overview
- Discusses using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) as a security best practice in Azure KeyVault.
- KeyVault offers two methods for access control: Access policy and RBAC.

### RBAC vs. Access Policy
- RBAC provides more granular access control features compared to Access policy.
- Allows specific access to individual secrets, use of groups, Privileged Identity Management (PIM), deny assignments, and centralized management.
- More effective for applications requiring access to specific secrets rather than all available secrets.

### Implementing RBAC with Terraform
- Guide on creating KeyVault with RBAC authorization using Terraform.
